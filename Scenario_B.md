Hi **Student's Name**,

Thank you for reaching out and letting us know about your situation. I’m very sorry to hear about your family emergency, and I hope your loved one is on the path to recovery.

We’re glad to assist with your request for an excused absence. Please send any documentation you may have, such as a hospital note, so we can review and officially record this absence. Once approved, this will not count against your allowed absences for the program.

Just as a reminder, this is your *first absence*, and each student is allowed up to *three excused absences* throughout the course.

Wishing you and your family strength during this challenging time. We look forward to seeing you in the next session.

All the best,

CodePath Support
