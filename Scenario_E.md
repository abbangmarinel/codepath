Hi **Student Name,**

Thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re having trouble joining the Zoom session, and I’m here to help you get connected as quickly as possible.

I’ve checked your GitHub account and everything appears to be in order. Since classes have already started, please try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify the session link – Make sure you are using the correct Zoom link for the course you are enrolled in.
2. Check your GitHub account – Ensure you are logged into the GitHub account associated with the course. Sometimes being logged into a different account can prevent access.
3. Clear your browser cache – Cached information can interfere with Zoom access, so clearing it may resolve the issue.
4. Retry joining the session after completing the above steps.

If you are still unable to join after trying these steps, please let me know immediately. At that point, I will provide the direct Zoom link so you can enter the session and catch up with the class.

Thank you for your cooperation and swift action. I look forward to assisting you in getting connected.

All the best,

CodePath Support
