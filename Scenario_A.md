Hi **Mae**,

Thank you for reaching out and letting us know about your situation. I’m sorry to hear about your injury, and I hope you are recovering well.

We have reviewed your request, and we’re able to excuse your absence for today’s session. Please note that this will not count against your two allowed absences for the program.

Just as a reminder, each student is allowed up to ***three excused absences*** throughout the course. Since this is already your second excused absence, we encourage you to use them carefully for any future unexpected circumstances.

Wishing you a smooth recovery, and we look forward to seeing you in the next session.


All the best,
CodePath Support
