Hi **Student Name**,

Thank you for reaching out and letting us know about your situation. I’m sorry to hear about your injury, and I hope you are recovering well.

We’re glad to assist with your request for an excused absence. Please send us proof of your doctor’s visit so we can review and process it. Once approved, this absence will not count against your two allowed absences.

Just as a reminder that each student is only allowed up to **three excused absences** for the program. If similar situations arise in the future, feel free to reach out so we can review your request.

Wishing you a smooth recovery, and we look forward to seeing you in the next session.

All the best,

CodePath Support
