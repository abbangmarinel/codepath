Hi **Student's Name**,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your situation. I understand that balancing coursework with personal and work responsibilities can be challenging, and I appreciate your dedication to the course.

Since you have already used your two allowed 48-hour deadline extensions and your request came after the submission deadline, we will treat this as a withdrawal appeal.

We are able to grant you a **1-week extension**, giving you **until next Friday** to submit Project 6. Please make sure to submit your assignment by this day to stay on track in the course and avoid any risk of withdrawal.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment, and we encourage you to complete the assignment on time within this extension.

All the best,

CodePath Support
